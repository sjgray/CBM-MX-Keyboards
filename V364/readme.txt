V364 MX Keyboard
================

This is a keyboard for the never-released V364 computer which was part of the TED series.
I designed this keyboard based on pictures of prototype machines as part of my project
to recreate the computer. The project is still in development.

I am releasing the design for people that might want a V364 keyboard for their PLUS/4 or
C16 computer which could be placed in a 3D-printed case.

The keyboard is tested and works. The numeric pad does not require any special software
to work as the keys are wired up as duplicates of existing keys in the regular PLUS/4
keyboard.
